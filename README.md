Gourmet Grubbers Documentation

**Overview**

The websites main purpose is to act as a space for sharing food recipes. 

Other than the sheer enjoyment of sharing foodie interests, Social capital seems to be the main current form of value being sought by the project owner. This social capital can be used in future if desired to create sales.

The website owner also writes about food in a newsletter, the website can also act partly as a portal to attract people to the Newsletter and also Social Media spaces.

Sign ups involving email address submission mean a mailing list can be progressively built up for future promotion and visibility via email campaigns. 

**Features**

Diverse food interests will have a presence on the website including vegan and gluten free types.

The branding and theme of the website is to present food types in line with the website title 'Gourmet Grubbers', that is, grub (ie everyday sorts of food) that has a gourmet twist (exotic enhancements mainly via variations/additions of ingredients used).

The website aims to deliver some recipes in a novel form, using carousels, to make the format for interaction more interesting than the expected 'recipe book' type of format. It is proposed that this might act as 'bait' to lure viewers and incite their curiosity to find out more aswell, while inflaming their desire for the food types presented.
