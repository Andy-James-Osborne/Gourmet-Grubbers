Gourmet Grubbers Documentation

## Overview

The websites main purpose is to act as a space for sharing food recipes. 

Other than the sheer enjoyment of sharing foodie interests, Social capital seems to be the main current form of value being sought by the project owner. This social capital can be used in future if desired to create sales.

The website owner also writes about food in a newsletter, the website can also act partly as a portal to attract people to the Newsletter and also Social Media spaces.

Sign ups involving email address submission mean a mailing list can be progressively built up for future promotion and visibility via email campaigns. 

##Features

Diverse food interests will have a presence on the website including vegan and gluten free types.

The branding and theme of the website is to present food types in line with the website title 'Gourmet Grubbers', that is, grub (ie everyday sorts of food) that has a gourmet twist (exotic enhancements mainly via variations/additions of ingredients used).

The website aims to deliver some recipes in a novel form, using carousels, to make the format for interaction more interesting than the expected 'recipe book' type of format. It is proposed that this might act as 'bait' to lure viewers and incite their curiosity to find out more aswell, while inflaming their desire for the food types presented.

**UX/UI**
Wireframes were created with a few different design possibilities in mind. So, you will find a few extra pages here or currently unused designs, included here for reference back to in future iterations. Wireframing was done in line with most essential User Stories. Considerations were to be eye catching, simple, novel and easy to find recipes. Must haves were in line with the core brief of providing recipes from the site owner to the public. Additional features and considerations, of lower priority, were surrounding increasing Newsletter signups, social media following and brand identity formation.
